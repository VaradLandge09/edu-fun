# This project aims to develop a supplemental educational curriculum designed to support students in building essential skills beyond traditional academic content. The platform will offer a rich, engaging experience by integrating interactive avatars and gamified learning environments tailored to different age groups and school years

Key Features

Age-Based Access: Students will gain access to learning content based on their grade level or age. For instance, a student in Grade 1 (approximately 6 years old) will be limited to content appropriate for that developmental stage.

Dual Modes – Learn & Test:

Learning Mode: Interactive and gamified, encouraging engagement through playful learning experiences.

Testing Mode: Presented in a more traditional, straightforward format to assess knowledge and understanding.

Performance & Progress:

Students earn scores within the learning environment.

Completion of daily challenges unlocks level-ups, digital rewards, and avatar accessories to encourage continued participation.

Early Childhood Focus:
Rooted in the principle that early childhood education thrives on association and sensory interaction, younger learners will explore foundational concepts such as colors, alphabets, and numbers through playful and intuitive activities.

***NOTE***
  Version 1 will focus completely on Mathematics. Like learning numbers, simple addition
Game Types to Support Cognitive Growth
Memory Match (match cards)

Sorting Games (colors, shapes)

Counting Objects

Find the Pattern

Quick Math (1–10)

“Which one doesn’t belong?” puzzles

Age-Based Difficulty Levels
Break content into age/level-based groups:

Age 4–5: Counting, matching shapes

Age 5–6: Simple addition, recognizing patterns

Age 6–7: Subtraction, ordering numbers

Age 7–8: Basic word problems, logic puzzles
